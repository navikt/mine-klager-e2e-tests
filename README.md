# Mine klager E2E tests
This app uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test that the app behaves as expected.

## Running the tests
`bun test`

The app depends on a few environment variables to send messages to Slack.
Without these it will output the same message updates to the console, it will be repeated a lot.

### Local
Locally the E2E application will not send messages to Slack. The Slack config is therefore not needed.

### GCP
```
kubectl create configmap slack-e2e-configmap \
--from-literal=klage_notifications_channel=klage-notifications

kubectl create secret generic slack-e2e-secrets \
--from-literal=slack_e2e_token=<token> \
--from-literal=slack_signing_secret=<secret>
```

As a one-time job, before the tests can run, we must apply the networkpolicy (nais/networkpolicy.yaml)
```
kubectl apply -f networkpolicy.yaml -n klage
```
